# VR-Android-application-for-chemistry-learning

The goal was to create an application that would depict the course of chemical reactions depending on the reaction equation, using videos. This would make learning chemistry more attractive and easier by giving quick and easy access to the experiments shown in the videos. There are a number of reactions with different pathways, and a detailed description of them is required for high school graduation or exams. It is necessary to know, among others, the color and consistency of the product, whether the reaction proceeds rapidly or slowly, etc., the application proposed by me would definitely facilitate learning.

The programming work was done in the Unity environment using an augmented reality tool called Vuforia. Working with the mentioned tool facilitates the implementation of virtual objects on a real background by creating a database composed of tags (targets) and information about them.

The video is accessed by hovering the smartphone's camera over a reaction equation in a chemistry textbook with a marker for possible interaction. Additionally, if you move the camera over a single chemical compound involved in the reaction, you get additional information about it.

The tests have shown that the application works effectively and meets its initial objectives. The targets for recognition are chemical formulas, which may pose a problem when developing the application with additional chemical compounds, as their structure may be too simplified.
